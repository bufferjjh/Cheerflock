    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">CheerFlock allows fans to interact with players through cheers and boos. The cheers and boos will then be calculated into crowd noise that will be piped into the arena at the discretion of the administrator. CheerFlock was designed to be simple and easy to use as it requires no registration.</p>
    <h1>Users</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">When a user first visits CheerFlock, he or she will be presented with all the games that are currently active. From there, users are allowed to join any active game session. Users can also join by entering the game code of a certain game. Inside a game session, you can either <b>Cheer</b> or <b>Boo</b>. Your feedback will be sent to the administrator of the game.</p>
    <h1>Admins</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">If you are a verified administrator, you can create and host a game. When you're hosting a game, you can turn cheer receiving on and off. When cheering receiving is on, all the cheers and boos that happen in your game will be broadcasted to you. With the gathered cheers and boos, you have the option to play the crowd. Playing the crowd will play crowd noise respective to the number of cheers and boos received. The sound can then be piped into the stadium or arena, simulating real crowd noise. We propose this will be beneficial to both the fans and the players as the crowd noise isn't random. Unfortunately, we do not know the power of your speaker(s) or the acoustics of your stadium. Therefore, you need to adjust your volume accordingly. The volume level played will be relative to your system volume.</p>
